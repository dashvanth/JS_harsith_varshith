# JavaScript Beginning To Mastery ðŸš€

Welcome to my JavaScript journey! ðŸ¤ª

## The Weird History of JavaScript

1. **Born at Netscape**: Created by Brendan Eich for Netscape Navigator in just 10 days (1995).
2. **Not Java**: Despite the name, it's unrelated to Javaâ€”just a marketing twist!
3. **Browser Wars**: JavaScript was a battleground in the infamous '90s browser wars.
4. **ECMAScript**: Official specification to bring consistency.

## ECMAScript: The Official Specification ðŸ“œ

1. **Standardization**: ECMAScript is a scripting language standard; JavaScript is its most popular implementation.
2. **Evolution**: It evolves with new features and improvements.
3. **ECMAScript Versions**: We have ES5, ES6 (ES2015), ES7, and more, each with its set of features.

## JavaScript vs. ECMAScript: What's the Difference? ðŸ¤”

1. **JavaScript**:
   - Practical usage in web development.
   - The language as implemented in browsers.
   - Variants like Node.js for server-side scripting.

2. **ECMAScript**:
   - The standardized specification.
   - Defines rules, syntax, and core features.
   - Implementations like JavaScript follow these rules.
