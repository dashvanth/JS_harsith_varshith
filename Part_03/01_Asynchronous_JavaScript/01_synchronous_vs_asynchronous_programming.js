// synchronous vs asynchronous programming 


// synchronous 
// js is a synchronous programming but single threaded 
// the below for script end doesn't execute until for loop completes. this is called synchronous 


// console.log("script start");

// for(let i=1;i<=10000;i++){
//     console.log("inside for loop");
// }
// console.log("script end");

// js can be made asynchronous 

// Asynchronous -> browser works on a particular code while callstack works on remaining and executes
